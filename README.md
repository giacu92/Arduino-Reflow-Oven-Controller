# Mounting the board:
Get a fully assembled board [here](http://giacu92.bigcartel.com/product/reflow-oven-controller-board-v1-1) or etch it yourself. -- available soon

A newer version of the pcb featuring two thermocouple interface, +12V fan output (for cooling) is under development. It will fit the 16x2 LCD screen and mounts underneath it. Here's a sample rendering. Also a new pid autotuner function and MicroSD card interface for saving custom profiles are getting implemented.
